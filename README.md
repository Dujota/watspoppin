Hello there! ✌️

Watspoppin is meant to show you what's going on and what is there to do in a certain place. This is
a group effort with which we satisfied the final project requirement for the Full Stack web
development bootcamp at Bitmaker.

Watspoppin allows you to see tweets in real time by listing them and plotting them on a map based on
a location of your choosing. Additionally, you can create your own story and post it on to Facebook
& Twitter if your accounts are linked.

Each person was in charge of testing their respective functionality.

Tasks:

* Denis Sanchez - Back end. In charge of user model. Worked with devise and omniauth.

* Enderson Isai - Back end. In charge of stories model. Worked with Google places api for search
  functionality in order to create stories from within the app.

* Marian Serna - Full Stack. Project Manager. In charge of real time functionality using the Twitter
  api, action cable, and google places api. Used celluloid::io for async functionality in rails.
  Designed site, implemented react on rails setup, developed the front end. Tested front end with
  Jest + Enzyme + Sinon as well as back end using Rspec and Factory Bot. Deployed to Heroku and set
  up rake tasks for db reset every 24 hours.
